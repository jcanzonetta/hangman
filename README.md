Hangman

A Ruby project with The Odin Project.

First exercise in writing and reading to files.

ToDo
- Make the hangman GUI instead of just listing number of tries
- Switch from YAML to Marshal or some other binary file (YAML was used due to simplicity and checking for the correct file output)
- Clean up the code (I ran into several hangups due to where I wanted to load and/or write a file. My code could be simplified for better readibility which I will probably notice when I come back to clean this up.)
